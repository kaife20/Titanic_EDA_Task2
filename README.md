# # Titanic EDA - Task 2 (Elevvo Training)

This repository contains my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
The task was part of my training with **Elevvo**, where I explored the dataset to uncover survival patterns and insights.
## ðŸ“Š What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns)  
- Analyzed survival by **gender, passenger class, and embarkation point**  
- Created **3 bar plots** and **2 heatmaps** to visualize patterns  
- Summarized findings with insights and a final conclusion  
## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights
- Females had a much higher survival rate (~74%) compared to men (~19%)  
- First-class passengers survived more than third-class passengers  
- The lowest survival rate was among **third-class males**  
- Strongest correlation with survival â†’ **Sex**, then **Class** and **Fare**  
## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
